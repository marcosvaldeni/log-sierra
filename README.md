# nail_care: Frontend

[Frondend Repository](https://github.com/marcosvaldeni/LogSierra)

[Project designed on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/RjiJK8Qy0ACzMEL8VzrDjA/LogSierra?node-id=0%3A1)

# :construction_worker: Installation

**You need to install at least [NodeJS 14.17.6](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and a Package Manager ([Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/)) and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), I would recommend use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).**

**In order to clone the project via HTTPS, run this command:**

```git clone https://github.com/marcosvaldeni/log-sierra.git```

SSH URLs provide access to a Git repository via SSH, a secure protocol. If you have an SSH key registered in your Github account, clone the project using this command:

```git clone github.com/marcosvaldeni/log-sierra.git```

### Database

**In case, you are using a Postgres local, you must have a database named as `logsierra`**

Suggesting using the follow commands:
```
DROP DATABASE if exists logsierra;
CREATE DATABASE logsierra;
```

**In case, you are using Docker, just run the follow command**

```
docker run \
  --name my_postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=my_password \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=my_user_name \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=logsierra \
  -p 5432:5432 \
```

name `[name of the container]` \
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=`[password ot the database]` \
POSTGRES_USER=`[username of the database]` \
POSTGRES_DB=`[database name]`

**Environment Variables**

Rename the file `.env.example` to `.env`, in this file you must set the same credential used on the Postgres database or/and Docker.

```
  APP_SECRET=dbad479cc6b946f3d6593b3e19b995d9
  APP_WEB_URL=http://localhost:3000

  DATABASE_URL = postgres://my_user_name:my_password@localhost:5432/logsierra
  ENTITIES = ./src/modules/**/infra/typeorm/entities/*.ts
  MIGRATIONS = ./src/shared/infra/typeorm/migrations/*.ts
  MIGRATIONSDIR = ./src/shared/infra/typeorm/migrations
```

  APP_SECRET=`[JWT key, this case I am using md5 hash]`
  APP_WEB_URL=`[application address]`

  DATABASE_URL = postgres://`[username of the database]`:`[password ot the database]`@localhost:5432/`[database name]`


**Install Dependencies**

In the project directory, you have to run:

On Yarn: `yarn`

On NPM: `npm i`

This command will install all dependencies. It may take a while.

# :runner: Getting Started

**Starting**

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn dev` or `npm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

It shoud shows:

```{"message":"LogSierra"}```

This message means the API is running!
